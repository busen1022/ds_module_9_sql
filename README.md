# README: ds_module_9_sql
This is a Data Bootcamp Homework Submission for Module 9 - SQL. In the homework, we used [QuickDBD](https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/) for Entity Relationship Diagram design and [pgAdmin4](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/) to create tables with SQL script generated on QuickDBD, import data to the created tables, and run queries based on eight questions asked in the Module 9 Challenge.

## Introduction

In this assignment, we were given six CSV, comma-seperated value, files as starter code. This was copied into a repository folder labelled [Submission](https://github.com/busen1022/ds_module_9_sql/tree/main/Submission), where all work on the assignment was saved. 

After copying the resource files into the Submission folder [data](https://github.com/busen1022/ds_module_9_sql/tree/main/Submission/data), we then used QuickDBD to create an ERD and save four files in the repository's folder labelled [QuickDBD](https://github.com/busen1022/ds_module_9_sql/tree/main/Submission/QuickDBD). This folder contains a text file of script used on QuickDBD, a PDF of the ERD, a PGN of the ERD, and a sql source file. We then used the sql source file in pgAdmin4 to create tables. After creating the tables, we imported each of the six CSV files into the corresponding tables created in pgAdmin4 and scripted queries based on the Challenge 9 questions from this homework assignment. A script of the query code and images of the results for each of the eight questions can be found in the repository folder named [SQL Queries](https://github.com/busen1022/ds_module_9_sql/tree/main/Submission/SQL%20Queries).
